# Project Title and Description

**Addis Adama Express Way**

I attempted to showcase one of Ethiopia's major expressway toll using fundamental Python programming.

## Getting Started

These project works best with IDLE python compiler. 
Download and Install IDLE to your local computer.

### Prerequisites

To open this project, you'll need to have cs1graphics.py in your directory. 
Follow the link below and consider placing it in a "site-packages" folder, the exact location of which depends on your Python installation. 

```
http://www.cs1graphics.org/download/current/singlethreaded/cs1graphics.py
```

To find the potential location on your machine, open Python and execute the following in the interpreter:

``` import sys; print([p for p in sys.path if 'site-packages' in p]) ```


## Running
Once installed you can run the program with running the file

```
python ExpressWay.py
```


## Thanks

I would like to express my gratitude to my instructor and fellow classmates at ASTU (Adama Science and Technology University) for their invaluable encouragement and support in the development of this project. Without their assistance, this project would not have been possible.
